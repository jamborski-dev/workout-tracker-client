### TODO

#### Features

- [x] Auth
- [x] Deployment

- [ ] loading states on all async calls to API (create routine etc.)
- [ ] routine notes
- [ ] new exercise form
- [ ] Templates
- [ ] User Settings

- [ ] test on other browsers
- [ ] integration and E2E

- [ ] toast messaging - maybe add a bar at the top instead having overlay element
- [ ] fix some API errors

- [ ] admin page for creating invites
- [ ] registration flow with invite only system
- [ ] tap on movement block to toggle edit along with the edit button
- [ ] /auth should redirect to /auth/login

- [ ] at some point make a dev and staging branches (staging for a moment should be treated as prod until full v1 is ready)

- [ ] add bundler to backend

- [ ] set .local .development .env so the prisma.schema can connect to the right DB

#### Refactor

- [ ] Add label option to IconButton component - requires moving it into FC from styled
- [ ] organize project files

Once routines are done I can start working on the family / house notes stuff
